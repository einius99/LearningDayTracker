To start IKEEA application you will need:

1. MySQL Server, which you can download from here - 
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

2. NOTE - while installing database you will be asked for a password.
Insert password - root12345, because later on it's hard to reset!!!

3. MySQL installed? Check if it's REALLY installed by typing in terminal mysql --version

4. Connect to the database - mysql -uroot -p (press enter here and then insert password root12345)

5. Now you need to create database locally, type - create database ikeea; (with column in the end)

6. Now you will need a JDK - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html

7. After installation open a terminal and check if it's properly installed by typing javac --version

8. Git clone this repository into your working directory

9. Open ikeea-backend project and in the right upper corner press 'Play' button!
